# Ignore files generated by Composer when installing the distribution.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
/vendor/

# Ignore scaffold files
#
# Note that the scaffold plugin may be used to automatically manage
# a site's .gitignore files. If the `vendor` directory is ignored,
# then one or more .gitignore files will be written to also ignore
# any file placed by scaffolding. To avoid the creation of
# additional .gitignore files, add all of the scaffold file
# locations to the top-level .gitignore file, as shown below.
